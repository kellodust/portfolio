<h2>The BYUI Music Department Website</h2>
<!--<img src="images/mountainspokeshop.png" alt="Mountain Spoke Screenshot">-->
    <p>The Music Department at BYU-Idaho needed a website revamp. I worked within the website standards and the 
        site builder platform for the university to change the look, feel and content of the site. The first steps to 
        this process was user feedback on what was wrong or out-of-date on the website according to the staff and 
        the students. The main goals were for the students to be able to find the most important links and most
        asked-for features first. The site as it currently stands is found at this
        <a href="http://www.byui.edu/music"><strong>link</strong></a>.

        <h2>A Whole New Look</h2>
        <p>While changing the interface to be more responsive and easier to understand, the entire look of the website was
            changed to more accurately represent the style guide of the univeristy as well as the department. Icons were
            created and colors and banner consistency was implemented. The final site, which holds dozens of pages and subpages,
            changed to reflect the department's new look and the need of the students.
