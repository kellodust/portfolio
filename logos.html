                insight in how to combine two different objects and create one unique symbol. Throughout this process
                I did user research many times. I would approach people showing only the icon, not the typography and
                ask them what they thought the symbol represented and meant. This type of user testing proved to be very 
                helpful. I was able to implement similar user testing in other logo projects. Overall, I think that this
                I was successful in communicating both the cactus and the sewing part of the brand through the logo.
