<h2>The Mountain Spoke Website</h2>
<!--<img src="images/mountainspokeshop.png" alt="Mountain Spoke Screenshot">-->
    <p>The Mountain Spoke Website was created for a fictional company in Bozeman, Montana. 
        This project consisted of first creating the company identity and target audience. 
        After, the overall design concept and plan was created. A brief version of this 
        design plan can be seen at this 
        <a href="https://kellodust.github.io/cit_230/assignments/lesson-12/websiteplan.pdf"><strong>link</strong></a>. 
        I then marked up the website and created a responsive design. 
        The design consists of several pages including a shop page, 
        a contact page and an event registration form. The finished 
        website can be found at this <a href="https://kellodust.github.io/cit_230/assignments/lesson-12/index.html"><strong>link.</strong></a></p>
