        Hello, my name is Kelsie Dustin. I'm currently a student at Brigham Young University—Idaho. I'm studying Graphic Design. I'm also studying a minor in Computer Information Technology, which means that <strong>this website was designed and developed all by myself.</strong> I'll be finishing my Bachelor's degree in the spring of 2020.<br><br>In the meantime I design a lot of stuff for my clients and for work. Though most of my graphic design work consists of typography, vector-based art, and web design, I work with several different mediums. <strong>I consider myself both a designer and an artist. </strong>Some of my more traditional work is used in my designs.<br><br>I'm always looking to learn more and for opportunities to share my work with others.</p>
