        Hello, my name is Kelsie Dustin. I'm currently a student at Brigham Young University—Idaho. 
        I'm studying Graphic Design with a minor in Computer Information Technology, 
        which means that this website was designed and developed myself. 
        I'll be finishing my Bachelor's degree in the spring of 2020.<br><br>In the meantime I design a 
        lot of stuff for my clients and for work. I have a special interest in UI/UX design and web design.
        <br>I am currently open to new opportunities including an internship and future positions in 
        the design field.</p>
