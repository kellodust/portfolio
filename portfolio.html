            <p>The Mountain Spoke Website was created for a fictional company in Bozeman, Montana. This project consisted of first creating the company identity and target audience. After, the overall design concept and plan was created. A brief version of this design plan can be seen at this <a href="https://kellodust.github.io/cit_230/assignments/lesson-12/websiteplan.pdf"><strong>link</strong></a>. I then marked up the website and created a responsive design. The design consists of several pages including a shop page, a contact page and an event registration form. The finished website can be found at this <a href="https://kellodust.github.io/cit_230/assignments/lesson-12/index.html"><strong>link.</strong></a></p>

            <p>The Rainy Day is a weather site. The target audience is wealthy travelers. 
                I designed and developed this site from scratch, however, this site is not actually 
                intended for your daily weather report. The information is accurate but this site 
                was designed strictly for design and developmental purposes. The actual site can be 
                found from my GitHub account at this

            <p>Binge is a microsite prototype design that publicly enforces the abuse of online video 
                streaming services like Netlix, YouTube, Hulu, and Amazon Prime Video. The site acts 
                as a public service announcement for those who often binge watch on these services. 
                This project was introduced as an information design project. The XD prototype can be found

        </div>
        <p>This project was for sexual assault awareness month. It was featured in an Exhibit put on 
            by the Family Crisis Center. The caption read: "There is no destination. But moving forward 
            day by day is the ultimate goal. As long as there is movement, there is progress."

        <p>This project presents a select few of the posters that I created recently. 
            With each poster created, several corresponding ads were created as well. Some of the ads 
            seen in this project include a TV ad (aka Digital Signage), a calendar ad for BYU-Idaho's 
            master calendar as well as a web banner used on the website. In this group of posters I 
            tried to focus on the design principles of space, focal point, heirarchy and others. Each 
            poster either promotes a musical event like a concert or recital given by a person or 
            ensemble, or promotes a musical class or class feature.

        <img src="images/3finalposter.jpg" alt="Anti-Pornography Poster 2">
        </div>
        <p>These three posters are a part of an anti-pornography public service announcement 
            campaign called "Leave the Door Open". For each poster I took photos of real 
            people as my template for my designs. Each person really was holding a device 
            in front of them or in their hands. I wanted each setting to feel genuine. 
            The people in the background represent those we love and may be hurting 
            while viewing pornography.

        <h3>The Grapes of Wrath Book Cover Design</h3>
        <img src="images/bookcovericon.png" alt="Book Cover">
        <p>For an academic project I was asked to recreate a book cover for a classic novel. 
            This book cover was created by photographs I took and then manipulated slightly. 
            Themes for the Grapes of Wrath include hard work, family, trial and poverty. These 
            themes were illustrated in the simplicity of the designa as well as the sullen saturation 
            and subject of the photograph.</p>

        <img id="portfolioicon" src="images/cactusFinal-13.png" alt="Cactus Icon">
        <p>For a start-up company based in the Teton Valley in Idaho, USA, I created a company logo 
            for them. Their name is Pinnacle Pest Elimination. The mountain range in the logo is 
            that of the Tetons seen from the Idaho side. </p>
