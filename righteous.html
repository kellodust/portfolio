            <h2>Graphic Design for Righteous Slice</h2><p>Righteous Slice is a restaurant
                that serves traditional Neapolitan Pizza. I became the company's head
                graphic designer when they opened and developed their brand from what they 
                already had (a logo and color scheme) to an identity.

            <h2>Signage and Atmosphere</h2><p>Projects included interior and exterior
                signage as well as designs for vinyl and paint. Much of what I designed as 
                drafts were later implemented into the interior.

            <h2>Working On Teams</h2><p>The iconic graffiti work there was originally
                designed by my input and specifics and was later executed by the graffiti artists.

            <h2>Promotions & Campaigns</h2><p>My projects included several marketing
                campaigns including an annual holiday sweepstakes. Included in these larger 
                campaigns were envelopes, cards, stickers, stamps, posters, table-toppers, and 
                social media images.

            <h2>Print & Digital</h2><p>The project above later was compiled into a booklet 
                for the customer to use as a punch card booklet for coupons. Print as well as digital 
                designs were needed. Digital designs always included social media images like some below.

            <h2>My Time At Righteous Slice</h2><p>Overall, I felt that the identity I helped to 
                produce for the brand became vital to their company and helped shape the influence the 
                place had on the customers.
