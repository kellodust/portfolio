<p>This project was for sexual assault awareness month. It was featured in an Exhibit put on 
    by the Family Crisis Center. The caption read: "There is no destination. But moving forward 
    day by day is the ultimate goal. As long as there is movement, there is progress."

        <div><h2>Type Inspired Poster</h2>
            <p>This poster, like most of the posters on this page, are a result of my time spent 
                designing for BYU-Idaho's Department of Music. This poster was one of my last that I 
                designed for the department. With every poster designed, there is also a TV ad, social media
                images, calendar images, web ads and occasionally banners.

    <h2>Icon Inspired Poster</h2>
    <p>I've always thought posters are an ideal canvas for implementing several design elements and
        principles in the same design. My motivation with every poster is to do that as much as 
        possible without taking away from the information on the poster. Instead, I want to use 
        typographic heirarchy, for example, to my advantage in displaying this type of information.
        This poster is an example of how the heirarchy and negative space worked together to make it
        cohesive.
