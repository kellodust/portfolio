           <div><h2>The Living Bread Booklet</h2>
          
               <p>This project consisted of creating a gift booklet with someone in mind that 
                   included a talk given in the last General Conference of the Church of Jesus 
                   Christ of Latter-day Saints. The booklet had to include folios with page 
                   numbers, a front and back cover, a photo and caption of the speaker as well 
                   as the full talk.</p>

               <div><h2>Adding all the details</h2><p>I took the liberty of including as well a table of contents, a section for notes, 
                   a personal letter to the recipient and references throughout the talk. 
                   This booklet focuses on the talk given by Elder D. Todd Christofferson, 
                   "The Living Bread Which Came Down From Heaven." </p></div>

               <div><h2>Matching the design to the content</h2><p>You will find a stair-step theme in the text—this is symbolic of the title 
                   of the talk. I wanted to emphasize the symbolism in the content because
                the talk was religously based. I also felt a need to simplify the design to only
            typographic work so that the content could shine through with only subtle symbolisms
        that illustrate the meaning of the talk.</p></div>

               <div><h2>Knowing the Audience</h2><p>As this project was meant to be a gift,
                   I felt that the most important thing was making sure the recipient loved it.
                   Knowing them well and knowing how organized they are, I knew that they would appreciate those little extra efforts 
                   like a page for notes and table of contents. I also knew that, as a fellow deep
                   thinker, they would appreciate the subtle symbolism and the emphasis on the content.
