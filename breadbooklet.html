           <div><h2>The Living Bread Booklet</h2>
          
               <p>This project consisted of creating a gift booklet with someone in mind that 
                   included a talk given in the last General Conference of the Church of Jesus 
                   Christ of Latter-day Saints. The booklet had to include folios with page 
                   numbers, a front and back cover, a photo and caption of the speaker as well 
                   as the full talk. I took the liberty of including as well a table of contents, 
                   a section for notes, a personal letter to the recipient and references 
                   throughout the talk. This booklet focuses on the talk given by Elder D. 
                   Todd Christofferson, "The Living Bread Which Came Down From Heaven." </p>
