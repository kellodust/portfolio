           <h3>Binge: The Real Enemy of Productivity Prototype</h3>
           <!--<img src="images/mountainspokeshop.png" alt="Mountain Spoke Screenshot">-->
               <p>Binge is a microsite prototype design that publicly enforces the abuse of online video 
                   streaming services like Netlix, YouTube, Hulu, and Amazon Prime Video. The site acts 
                   as a public service announcement for those who often binge watch on these services. 
                   This project was introduced as an information design project. The XD prototype can be found
