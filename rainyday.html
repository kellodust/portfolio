        <p>The Rainy Day is a weather site. The target audience is wealthy travelers. 
            I designed and developed this site from scratch, however, this site is not actually 
            intended for your daily weather report. The information is accurate but this site 
            was designed strictly for design and developmental purposes. The actual site can be 
            found from my GitHub account at this 
            <a href="https://kellodust.github.io/cit_230/assignments/weather-site/index.html"><strong>
                link.</strong>
