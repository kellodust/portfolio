    <h2>The Rainy Day: A weather site</h2>
    <!--<img src="images/mountainspokeshop.png" alt="Mountain Spoke Screenshot">-->
        <p>The Rainy Day is a weather website created for learning purposes. The target audience
            was wealthy travelers. I designed the look of the site after that audience. The 
            weather information is accurate and has been implemented using JSON.

            <h2>User Testing</h2><p>The site consists of 6 full pages and includes a gallery, form, tables and 
                other features. The user testing I performed for this site was particularly helpful in
                navigation and wayfinding.
