<p>This project was for sexual assault awareness month. It was featured in an Exhibit put on 
    by the Family Crisis Center. The caption read: "There is no destination. But moving forward 
    day by day is the ultimate goal. As long as there is movement, there is progress."

        <div><h2>String Chamber Ensemble</h2>
            <p>This poster, like most of the posters on this page, are a result of my time spent 
                designing for BYU-Idaho's Department of Music. This poster was one of my last that I 
                designed for the department. With every poster designed, there is also a TV ad, social media
                images, calendar images, web ads and occasionally banners.

    <p>I've always thought posters are an ideal canvas for implementing several design elements and
        principles in the same design. My motivation with every poster is to do that as much as 
        possible without taking away from the information on the poster. Instead, I want to use 
        typographic heirarchy, for example, to my advantage in displaying this type of information.
        This poster is an example of how the heirarchy and negative space worked together to make it
        cohesive.

            <p>Derek Brown is a saxophone beat-boxer. I wanted his poster to appear as fun and unique 
                as he is. My research for this project was watching videos of his past performances and 
                learning how to portray music through design. I think the "research" paid off because
                he later posted the image on all his social media platforms, mentioned how much he
                loved it in the concert, and gave me a signed copy of his album.

                    <p>The description I received of the concert contained the words "patriotic jazz". 
                        After sketches and illustrations, I came up with something I felt portrayed the 
                        description accurately.

        <p>This project also gave me a unique project description. I was told that the music 
            played would combine time travel and world travel. I didn't want the design to be
            overwhelming so I felt that using different skylines from different times and places
            would be a good way to communicate the theme. I made sure that the places and the 
            times were the same ones that would be represented in the concert.

                <p>This poster project focused on the principle of negative space. I find that
                    the more I focus on incorporating the principles of design into my work, 
                    the happier I am with it.

<p>This project presents a select few of the posters that I created recently. 
    With each poster created, several corresponding ads were created as well. Some of the ads 
    seen in this project include a TV ad (aka Digital Signage), a calendar ad for BYU-Idaho's 
    master calendar as well as a web banner used on the website. In this group of posters I 
    tried to focus on the design principles of space, focal point, heirarchy and others. Each 
    poster either promotes a musical event like a concert or recital given by a person or 
    ensemble, or promotes a musical class or class feature.

 <!-- <h3>Leave the Door Open—An Anti-Pornography Campaign</h3>

</div>
<p>These three posters are a part of an anti-pornography public service announcement 
    campaign called "Leave the Door Open". For each poster I took photos of real 
    people as my template for my designs. Each person really was holding a device 
    in front of them or in their hands. I wanted each setting to feel genuine. 
    The people in the background represent those we love and may be hurting 
    while viewing pornography.
