<p>This project was for sexual assault awareness month. It was featured in an Exhibit put on 
    by the Family Crisis Center. The caption read: "There is no destination. But moving forward 
    day by day is the ultimate goal. As long as there is movement, there is progress."

<p>This project presents a select few of the posters that I created recently. 
    With each poster created, several corresponding ads were created as well. Some of the ads 
    seen in this project include a TV ad (aka Digital Signage), a calendar ad for BYU-Idaho's 
    master calendar as well as a web banner used on the website. In this group of posters I 
    tried to focus on the design principles of space, focal point, heirarchy and others. Each 
    poster either promotes a musical event like a concert or recital given by a person or 
    ensemble, or promotes a musical class or class feature.

 <!-- <h3>Leave the Door Open—An Anti-Pornography Campaign</h3>

</div>
<p>These three posters are a part of an anti-pornography public service announcement 
    campaign called "Leave the Door Open". For each poster I took photos of real 
    people as my template for my designs. Each person really was holding a device 
    in front of them or in their hands. I wanted each setting to feel genuine. 
    The people in the background represent those we love and may be hurting 
    while viewing pornography.
