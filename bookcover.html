        <h3>The Grapes of Wrath Book Cover Design</h3>
        <img src="images/bookcovericon.png" alt="Book Cover">
        <p>For an academic project I was asked to recreate a book cover for a classic novel. 
            This book cover was created by photographs I took and then manipulated slightly. 
            Themes for the Grapes of Wrath include hard work, family, trial and poverty. These 
            themes were illustrated in the simplicity of the designa as well as the sullen saturation 
            and subject of the photograph.</p>
