        <h3>The Grapes of Wrath Book Cover Design</h3>
        <img src="images/bookcovericon.png" alt="Book Cover">
        <p>I created a book cover for the classic novel, The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck. 
            This project consisted of taking several of my own photographs for the design and 
            manipulating them in a way that would create a symbolic meaning for the book. 
            </p>
            <div class="four-column">
            <img src="images/bookcover1.jpg" alt="Book Cover">
            <img src="images/bookcover2.jpg" alt="Book Cover">
            <img src="images/bookcover3.jpg" alt="Book Cover">
            <img src="images/bookcover4.jpg" alt="Book Cover">
        </div>
        <p>After taking several different photos, I decided to stick with the theme of wheat in the hands. 
            In the novel, the characters suffer greatly from poverty and other trials. In my mind, the 
            wheat (or wheat-like plant) represented prosperity and happiness. In many of the photos taken, 
            the wheat is falling out of the hands, or is being held onto as if it is precious. </p>

            <div class="logo-display"><img src="images/bookcover5.png" alt="Book Cover">

            <p>After choosing the right photograph, I made a few more changes, editing the stray wheat so 
                that it appeared darker and almost diseased, as if the wheat was going bad. The wheat left 
                in his hand, however, is still good. He is cradling it as if it is the last best thing. </p></div>
