<h2>Acaí: An Infographic</h2>
    <!--<img src="images/mountainspokeshop.png" alt="Mountain Spoke Screenshot">-->
        <p>This passion project features an infographic about acaí and the origin thereof. 
            It features the information about the Amazon and the importance of the 
            acaí berry to the Amazon Rainforest.</p>

            <div><h2>Having Passion for the Work</h2><p>The infographic was particularly special to 
                me because of the passion I had for the information in it. I've spent a year and a half
                in the Amazon Rainforest so when I started the project I wanted to give the design and the 
                research the time it deserved. 
                The Amazon people have a very rich culture and are curiously obsessed with the acaí berry. The berry
                was the perfect subject for my infographic as I truly felt that what I was able to communicate in the
                infographic would help others to understand their love and need for the berry.
