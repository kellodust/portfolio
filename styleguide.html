        <p>This project is a web style guide for a fictional web magazine, InSight. 
            This website includes an article regarding a 2011 interview with Food Network 
            Chef Bobby Flay. The page includes questions and answers in the original article, 
            a quote from Bobby Flay's website that acts as the bodycopy for the page, as well 
            as a list to find some of his recipes. The challenge of this project was to use 
            two fonts and only two fonts, at least three colors, and a header and footer 
            to the website. The full project and more details can be found
            <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/58845243/Web-Style-Guide"><strong>here</strong></a>
