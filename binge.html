           <!--<img src="images/mountainspokeshop.png" alt="Mountain Spoke Screenshot">-->
               <p>Binge is a microsite prototype design that publicly enforces the abuse of online video 
                   streaming services like Netlix, YouTube, Hulu, and Amazon Prime Video. The site acts 
                   as a public service announcement for those who often binge watch on these services. 
                   This project was introduced as an information design project. The XD prototype can be found

               <p>Originally, the home button of the navigation header was in the center, reading simply "binge". 
                   After user-testing I realized many people were confused as to which direction they should go
                   and which page they should look at next. After realizing this, I moved the home button to 
                   the left and placed everything else from left to right in the ideal order.

               <p>Learning about my target audience for this project was vital. The majority of the "streamers" were
                   within ages 12-26. I wanted the design and feel of the site to appeal to that audience the most. 
                   I purposely incorporated a trendy feel made to mimic the platform of the streaming services
                   themselves. The design, combined with the research and dynamic display, proved to be a major interest
                   to the final group of users.
